This cate is combined with wannier90's wannier model or tight-bind model to calculate some physical properties such as conductivity, energy band, density of states, edge states, surface Green's function, etc.


Using this cate, you must use num-complex, ndarray and ndarray-linalg. For ndarray-linalg, you'd better open the features like "intel-mkl-static" or "openblas-static". The details see https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray-linalg
